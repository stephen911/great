                    ~ This program is a chess game. The user may play against a friend or the
                    ~ computer.
                    ~
                    ~ The game state is mainly stored as a 2D list of strings, and most of the
                    ~ processing is thus done on a list of strings.
                    ~
                    ~ The GUI takes the current state and displays it on the screen. The GUI allows
                    ~ drag and drop movement of pieces as well as click-click movement.
                    ~
                    ~ The AI that plays against the human evaluates all possible moves made by either
                    ~ player up to a certain level of depth. The AI evaluates each position by giving
                    ~ it a score. The higher the value of the score, the more favourable a position
                    ~ is for white and the lower the value of the score, the more favourable the
                    ~ position is for black. Knowing that white will try to get the score to be higher
                    ~ and black will try and get the score to be lower, the AI assumes best play from
                    ~ either side as it traverses up the search tree and chooses the best move to be
                    ~ played. A problem that may arise is the number of postions that need to be
                    ~ evaulated. Even at 3 levels of depth, thousands of positions have to be
                    ~ evaluatd.
                    ~ Several methods are used in this program to reduce positions that are searched:
                        ~ 1. Alpha-beta pruning: As a result of  evaluating a position it can be found
                        ~ that a portion of the search tree can be ignored as no further evaluations can
                        ~ guarantee better results. This can happen because white and black area against
                        ~ one another. White plays what is best for it and black plays what is best for it,
                        ~ so it would make sense for white to ignore any portion of the tree where black
                        ~ has a clear upperhand that it can choose to play.
                        ~ 2. Transposition table: Often, two different pathways in a search tree can result
                        ~ in the same board being evaluated. Instead of evaluating the same board several
                        ~ times, the program stores a table of values in a dictionary where the keys are
                        ~ the positions. This way, repeated positions can have their evaluations looked up
                        ~ fairly quickly, as the board state is hashed.
                        ~ 3. Opening Book - The opening book is again a dictionary that stores board
                        ~ positions often seen in the beginning few moves in chess. Appropraite moves that
                        ~ can be played at such positions is stored in the dictionary. A random move is
                        ~ selected and played from the list of suggested moves wihtout searching if the AI
                        ~ finds itself confronting a such a board postion. Note that this opening book was
                        ~ recorded by myself and so it does not have many positions stored in it.
                        ~
                        ~ In order to traverse the search tree as above, the AI needs to know how to evaluate the
                        ~ board at any position to decide if white or black has the advantage. My evaluation
                        ~ function currently looks at three main things when evaluating the board:
                            ~    a) Material for white and black. Each piece has a value and the more pieces you have,
                            ~        the better off your position is likely to be. For example, if white has an extra
                            ~        queen, it has an advantage over black.
